# Mid Term Project - TinyLinks

## Goal

This project will have you building a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

You will build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way you'll practice some advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and you'll also understand more about Express, a web framework which is very popular in the Node community.

## Project Outcome

You will build a simple multipage app:

- with authentication protection
- that reacts appropriately to the user's logged-in state,
- and permits the user to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) a simple entity (e.g. blog posts, URL shortener).

## User Stories

_As an_ avid twitter poster,

_I want_ to be able to shorten links

_so that_ I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

_As a_ twitter reader,

_I want_ to be able to visit sites via shortened links,

_so that_ I can read interesting content.

(Stretch) _As an_ avid twitter poster,

_I want_ to be able to see how many times my subscribers visit my links

_so that_ I can learn what content they like.

## Project Requirements

- Express
- HTML+CSS / EJS
- FS module (read and write files)
- Cookie Session (encrypted cookies)
- Body Parser

## Bonus
- Bcrypt (password hashing)

### Site Header:

if a user is logged in, the header shows:

- the user's email
- a logout button which makes a POST request to /logout

if a user is not logged in, the header shows:

- a link to the login page (/login)
- a link to the registration page (/register)
